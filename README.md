You will begin by choosing Ubuntu 20.04 as your OS to run ROS Noetic. This should be reserved for your personal machines and Virtual Machines. NOT THE NANOS!<br /> 
The guide gives links to multiple articles on how to do this. If you are using a Nano the guide will be linked in the Nano section of this guide.<br />
If you are using a virtual machine this is a helpful article if you are using Oracle on how to set up Ubuntu 20.04 <br />
